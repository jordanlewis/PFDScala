PFDScala is a repository containing the work I've done to write up the examples
and exercises from Mike Okasaki's Purely Functional Data Structures in Scala.

This repository supplements the blog post series I'm doing on the topic. The
series can be found on [my blog](http://jordanlewis.org/blog/categories/pfds/).
